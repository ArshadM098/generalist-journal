This is a summary of the project I did for my Image Processing Class.
The method is an experimental approach at Image Denoising using Reinforcement Learning that creates an adaptive filter for the image.

<C.Text1>
Image denoising is one of the key operations in the field of image processing. It is well-known that images are 2D signals
and are prone to signal noise generated from various sources. The exact nature of this noise cannot be determined for
which most of the noise is modelled using stochastic functions. In this paper, we propose an approach for designing an
Adaptive Filter using Reinforcement Learning Mechanisms to perform Image denoising.
